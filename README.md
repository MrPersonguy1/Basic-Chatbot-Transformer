🤖 Basic Transformer Chatbot
This is a simple project where you will build and test a chatbot using a transformer model. The chatbot uses LangChain and Groq APIs to run a pre-trained LLM (Language Model) called llama3-8b-8192.

🧠 What It Does
Loads a transformer-based chatbot model

Uses API keys to connect with LangChain and Groq services

Lets you type questions and get intelligent responses

Demonstrates how machine learning models can be used in conversation

🧰 Tools and Libraries
LangChain – A framework to use and deploy LLMs

LangGraph – Helps run structured LLM workflows

Groq – A model provider for fast inference

Python Libraries: os, getpass

📦 Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and run the following in your Colab or terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install langchain-core langgraph>0.2.27
pip install -U langchain langchain-openai
pip install -qU "langchain[groq]"
🔐 API Key Setup
Before using the model, you must:

Get your Groq and LangChain API keys.

Enter them when prompted using getpass.

These keys let you securely access the model online.

🧪 How to Run the Chatbot
Run the notebook or Python file.

When asked, enter your API keys.

The chatbot will load.

Ask it any question and get a response!

💡 Example Question
python
Copy
Edit
model.invoke("What is the capital of France?")
# → Response: "The capital of France is Paris."
📚 Learning Goals
Understand how APIs connect to machine learning models

Learn how transformer models handle language

Practice using Python for AI projects

⚠️ Notes
Do NOT share your API keys with anyone.

This project is for educational use only.
